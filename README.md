# Dotfiles
All my dotfiles for the various window managers or programs I use.

To replicate my configurations:
1. Clone this repo.

```git clone https://github.com/UberMayinch/Dotfiles```

2. Make sure you have all the applications you want to configure. 

Applications configured currently:         
i3, nvim, polybar, picom                   
                                           
```sudo pacman -S i3 nvim polybar picom``` 

3. Create a sym-link to this directory from your .config directory (after installing the applications you want to configure ofc)

```ln -s ~/Dotfiles/ ~/.config```
